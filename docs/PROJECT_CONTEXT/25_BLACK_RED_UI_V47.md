# 25 — BLACK / RED UI V47

Status at creation: GitHub-prepared runtime UI overlay. Do not call it production-confirmed until the user posts the successful deploy marker.

V47 is presentation-only. It was requested after the user showed the comprehensive-report page and asked for:

- a black/red visual identity instead of the existing navy/brown/orange feel;
- the Darma logo to be visible in the sidebar instead of appearing as a blank/light plaque;
- a cleaner, equal four-column KPI strip in the comprehensive report;
- a safe backup and one-command rollback if the new look is not preferred.

## Absolute boundary

V47 must not change:

- models or migrations;
- routes/views;
- accounting formulas;
- inventory quantities or HOME/KHORSHID semantics;
- SaleLine / SaleAllocation / SaleSnapshot;
- Dia Gallery accounting;
- Digikala logic/API behavior;
- payments/materials/production/returns;
- capital or valuation formulas.

## Runtime overlay architecture

V47 intentionally does **not** rewrite the tracked production CSS or templates.

Deploy script:

```bash
bash server_black_red_ui_v47.sh
```

The script:

1. creates a PostgreSQL backup;
2. backs up the tracked current `static/core/ui-polish.css`, logo asset and Git HEAD under `backups/before-black-red-ui-v47-*`;
3. builds a clean web image from current Git source;
4. verifies migrations/Django/templates;
5. captures exact economic invariants;
6. recreates the clean web container;
7. appends a V47 presentation-only CSS overlay **inside the running web container** to `/app/static/core/ui-polish.css`;
8. reruns `collectstatic` and restarts the same container so WhiteNoise's manifest uses the themed stylesheet;
9. proves the business snapshot is unchanged.

Because the tracked CSS source is left untouched, rollback is deterministic: recreating/rebuilding the web container from Git source removes the runtime overlay.

Rollback script:

```bash
bash server_rollback_black_red_ui_v47.sh
```

It takes another DB backup, rebuilds a clean image from current Git source, force-recreates web, verifies the V47 marker is absent, compiles templates, and proves business invariants did not move.

Rollback branch representing the pre-V47 Git state:

```text
before-black-red-ui-v47-20260831
```

## Visual contract

V47 palette:

- base: near-black / charcoal;
- panels: charcoal glass, not blue;
- primary accent: Darma red;
- hover/focus: brighter red;
- positive financial semantics remain green;
- error/danger semantics remain red.

The existing Darma artwork is displayed as a white logo on a dark plaque. The old light plaque is overridden.

Comprehensive report KPI strip:

- four equal columns on desktop;
- equal-height cards;
- consistent padding and numeric alignment;
- two columns on tablet/mobile;
- one column only on very narrow screens.

## Operational note

V47 is a runtime overlay by design. Any later `--force-recreate`/fresh image deployment removes the overlay unless `server_black_red_ui_v47.sh` is run again afterward. This is intentional because the user explicitly wanted an easy reversible visual trial without risking business source.
