# 08 — LIVE STATE AND CHECKPOINTS

This file records confirmed production/historical checkpoints. These numbers are for continuity and forensic reconciliation. They are **not permanent targets** and must never be force-restored after legitimate later activity unless the user explicitly requests a rollback to that checkpoint.

Last synchronized: 2026-08-29 after confirmed V38 UI modernization deployment.

---

## 1. Latest confirmed live deployment: V38

The user posted successful production output after running the V38 UI-only deployment.

Explicit success marker:

```text
SUCCESS: UI MODERNIZATION V38 DEPLOYED
```

Final invariant output:

```text
CAPITAL=5430972371
FINISHED=1115731500
RAW=1994448050
DIGI=812517154
DARMA=12072
TAKVIN=1195
NOVANI=3630
SALES=202
ACCOUNT_ENTRIES=206
```

Backup created by that deployment:

```text
backups/before-ui-modernization-v38-20260829-223111.sql
```

The deploy output explicitly stated:

```text
V38 application change: static/core/ui-polish.css only
Routes/Python/templates/models/migrations/workflow JS: unchanged
Accounting/inventory/sales/material/payment/return/calculator semantics: unchanged
All protected economic invariants: unchanged
```

Therefore V38 is now the latest confirmed production version.

### Important capital continuity note

The prior confirmed V37 checkpoint was:

```text
CAPITAL=5441972371
```

The confirmed V38 deployment boundary was:

```text
CAPITAL=5430972371
```

Difference from the older V37 checkpoint:

```text
-11000000
```

Do **not** attribute this 11,000,000 decrease to V38. The V38 deployment script captured the live snapshot before the UI deployment and compared it byte-for-byte with the final snapshot; deployment succeeded only because all protected economic invariants were unchanged during the deploy.

Therefore the 11,000,000 difference occurred through legitimate production activity or business-data changes **between the historical V37 checkpoint and the start of the V38 deployment**. The provided deployment output does not identify the specific business event, so do not guess or force-reconcile it.

The V38 numbers above are now the latest confirmed live checkpoint, not a reset target.

---

## 2. Latest confirmed feature semantics live at V38 checkpoint

V38 changed presentation only. Operational/economic behavior remains the V37 business baseline.

### Global UI

- V38 presentation layer is live through `static/core/ui-polish.css`;
- darker/refined navy glass visual language;
- refined sidebar/topbar/cards/tables/forms/buttons/responsive presentation;
- no route/view/template/model/migration/workflow-JS semantic change in V38.

### Daily report

- uses `daily_report_v8`;
- renders pre-return `daily_report_v21.html`;
- no inline return box.

### Standalone return

- `/returns/` page;
- mode color/code;
- Darma/Takvin;
- size selection;
- HOME-only positive stock effect;
- no sale/profit/Digikala/account effect.

### Calculator

- current Jalali-month realized Darma/Takvin profit-on-cost basis;
- exact current `digikala_fee_for_unit()` fee engine;
- new cost -> minimum price to preserve current margin;
- suggestion rounded upward to 1,000 toman.

### Comprehensive report

- V36 visual grouping remains active through `report_excel_v36.html`;
- calculation remains `report_v9`;
- V38 global CSS modernizes presentation without changing report arithmetic/forms.

### Material report

- V22 routes / V35 template behavior active;
- Darma + Novani cumulative delivery editable both directions;
- sewing wage 110,000 per 12 delivered pieces;
- cut comparison display with reverse-model cut fix;
- V38 changes presentation only.

## 3. Previous confirmed live deployment: V37

The V37 production deployment previously succeeded with:

```text
SUCCESS: STANDALONE RETURNS + CALCULATOR V37 DEPLOYED
```

Historical V37 invariant snapshot:

```text
CAPITAL=5441972371
FINISHED=1115731500
RAW=1994448050
DIGI=812517154
DARMA=12072
TAKVIN=1195
NOVANI=3630
SALES=202
ACCOUNT_ENTRIES=206
```

Historical V37 backup:

```text
backups/before-standalone-returns-calculator-v37-20260829-205844.sql
```

These V37 values are retained for forensic continuity only. They are superseded as the latest live checkpoint by V38.

---

## 4. 31 Mordad capital checkpoint

User stated the correct total capital on end of 31 Mordad was:

```text
5,471,152,736 toman
```

This was used as the opening capital checkpoint for the Shahrivar forensic rebuild.

The user's separately calculated profit from start of Shahrivar through the then-entered reports was:

```text
72,012,896 toman
```

Pure opening + sale-profit arithmetic would be:

```text
5,471,152,736
+  72,012,896
=5,543,165,632
```

However the project correctly noted that other capital-changing inventory/purchase adjustments can make actual current capital differ from opening + sale profit. Never force current capital to this arithmetic without reconciling all components.

---

## 5. Digikala 31 Mordad base/reference mentioned by user

User stated a 31 Mordad Digikala receivable reference of:

```text
872,647,000 toman
```

A later audit found sale profit matched exactly and the then-current Digikala discrepancy was only around 470 toman, narrowing the major capital discrepancy away from sale-profit and Digikala formulas.

Important: the editable comprehensive-report Digikala field stores desired current total by converting it to base = desired - ledger. See accounting docs.

---

## 6. Historical Shahrivar rebuild checkpoint after days 1-3

User reset/re-entered daily sales and then stated that after entering through 3 Shahrivar, total capital was correct at:

```text
5,493,056,769 toman
```

This is a historical debugging checkpoint immediately before the requested exact physical inventory adjustment for end of day 3.

Do not assume it remains the correct current capital after subsequent physical reconciliation, material/Novani production, payments or returns.

---

## 7. Authoritative physical Darma end-of-day 3 Shahrivar baseline

Physical sheets for HOME and KHORSHID established:

```text
HOME      = 4,585 shorts
KHORSHID  = 8,890 shorts
TOTAL     = 13,475 shorts
```

Per size:

```text
M    = 1,948
L    = 3,807
XL   = 2,529
XXL  = 3,716
3XL  = 1,071
4XL  =   404
```

Per color total:

```text
مشکی          2,248
سفید          1,077
سرمه ای       2,434
صورتی         1,477
کرم           2,297
قرمز            450
زرد              110
طوسی             212
راه راه           464
راه راه طوسی    1,699
برعکس مشکی        375
برعکس سفید        347
برعکس سرمه ای     285
```

Critical corrected cells:

```text
KHORSHID / کرم / XXL  = 400
KHORSHID / قرمز / XXL = 0
HOME / کرم / 3XL      = 77
Darma total / طوسی / 4XL = 0
```

This is a historical physical truth point after day-3 sales; do not reapply day-3 sales after setting this baseline.

---

## 8. Historical pre-physical audit immediately around V18

Older audited Darma quantity:

```text
13,467 shorts
```

Physical baseline:

```text
13,475 shorts
```

Difference:

```text
+8 shorts
```

At the then-current 61,000 accounting value:

```text
+488,000 toman
```

A prior user-reported post-V18 capital was:

```text
5,485,803,435
```

and inventory total:

```text
3,129,524,600
```

These are historical continuity values only.

---

## 9. Historical 31 Mordad Darma workbook baseline

During the sales bug reconstruction, a workbook `mojodi 31 mordad.xlsx` was treated as the authoritative aggregate Darma end-of-31-Mordad starting inventory.

Totals:

```text
TOTAL = 14,864 shorts
M     = 2,109
L     = 4,096
XL    = 3,002
XXL   = 4,106
3XL   = 1,143
4XL   =   408
```

At 61,000 per short:

```text
906,704,000 toman
```

The workbook itself contained some negative cells and those were preserved as historical Excel truth instead of being arbitrarily zeroed.

The workbook did not provide HOME/KHORSHID split; the baseline implementation preserved KHORSHID and adjusted HOME so each aggregate color/size matched the workbook.

This baseline is historical and must not be applied on current production unless explicitly rebuilding from 31 Mordad again.

---

## 10. Novani current block / inventory continuity

A real Novani material-report delivery contained:

```text
مشکی   710
سفید   660
سرمه‌ای 750
صورتی  700
کرم    810
TOTAL 3,630
```

The confirmed V38 checkpoint still shows:

```text
NOVANI=3630
```

Current sewing wage for that 3,630-piece delivered block was historically established as:

```text
33,275,000 toman
```

at 110,000 per 12.

---

## 11. Elastic payment #6 historical checkpoint

Diagnostic details:

```text
payment_id=6
created_at=2026-08-29 08:08:13.161618+00:00
actual paid=25,584,000
elastic16 q=5 kg, p=2,600,000/kg
elastic25 q=5 kg, p=2,600,000/kg
invoice/goods value=26,000,000
```

Capital difference from goods value - actual paid:

```text
+416,000
```

At one diagnostic moment aggregate stock showed 10/10 instead of purchase-ledger 5/5, leading to V28 forensic work. Do not infer current raw stock from that historical anomaly; the V38 RAW checkpoint above is the latest confirmed aggregate value.

---

## 12. Current production values are mutable after this checkpoint

The V38 checkpoint is the latest value known to this documentation. As soon as the user records any new:

- sale;
- return;
- production output;
- material consumption;
- purchase;
- payment;
- Digikala receipt;
- manual account change;
- inventory adjustment;

one or more checkpoint values can legitimately change.

A new AI/chat should treat the V38 numbers as **last confirmed at the successful V38 deployment boundary**, not as a database constraint or reset target.

---

## 13. How to establish a new live checkpoint

For a new phase, run a read-only snapshot using the same components used in guarded deploy scripts:

```text
capital
finished inventory value
raw material total
Digikala receivable
Darma qty
Takvin qty
Novani qty
SaleLine count
AccountEntry count
```

Record the date/time and the business action boundary so comparisons remain meaningful.
