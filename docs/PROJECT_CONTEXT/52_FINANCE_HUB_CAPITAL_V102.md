# V102 — FINANCE HUB CONSOLIDATION + CANONICAL CURRENT CAPITAL

Prepared: 2026-10-01  
Branch: `v102-finance-hub-consolidated`  
Base: V100 `775d598b5449c2ef9752a9a6724297c396a5309e`

## User intent

Finance & Tools is one primary destination, not an expandable sidebar group.

Opening `/finance/` must show exactly three cards:

1. **پرداخت‌ها** → the existing payments/receipts workflow, unchanged.
2. **حساب‌ها** → the account-management UI historically located in Comprehensive Report.
3. **محاسبه‌گر** → the current calculator, unchanged for now.

The Finance hub itself must not repeat account balances below the cards.

## Branch-lineage conflict resolved

V100 and V101 were sibling branches from V99, not a linear continuation.

- V100 had the desired direct Finance root and account visibility work.
- V101 restored an expandable Finance submenu, which conflicts with the user's explicit final UX.
- V102 therefore continues from V100 and intentionally does **not** merge the V101 submenu behavior.

V102 is the authoritative continuation for this Finance restructuring.

## Accounts source of truth

No account data is copied or migrated.

`/finance/accounts/` continues to read:

- `ExcelManualRow.ACCOUNTS`
- `ExcelManualRow.PERSONS`
- `ExcelManualSetting(digikala_receivable)`
- `ExcelManualSetting(takvin_debt)`
- the existing Digikala account ledger
- the existing Dia Gallery receivable ledger

Mutations still route through `report_v10.manual_report_action()`, preserving:

- desired Digikala total -> stored base conversion;
- protected system-managed «خودم» tracking row;
- existing manual account/person validation.

Payments/receipts routes and their accounting semantics are unchanged.

## Canonical current-capital calculation

The economic formula is unchanged:

```text
capital =
    accounts/persons + Dia receivable
  + finished inventory
  + raw materials
  + Digikala receivable
  - Takvin debt
  + assets
```

V102 removes the duplicate implementation of this current-capital formula from `report_v10.py`.

The single canonical current calculator is now:

`core.capital_history_v87.current_capital_breakdown()`

It explicitly exposes:

```text
inventory_total = finished_inventory_total + materials_total
capital_total =
    accounts_total
  + inventory_total
  + digikala_receivable
  - takvin_debt
  + assets_total
```

`report_v10` consumes these canonical values instead of independently recomputing them.

This is a structural consistency fix only. No business formula, valuation rule, fee rule, stock rule, payment rule, or ledger rule is changed.

## Historical-capital boundary

V87 historical capital remains ledger reconstruction, not a guaranteed full historical snapshot where old values were overwritten without history.

V102 does not invent missing historical cost/revaluation data. The historical-warning behavior remains in place.

## Finance navigation

The global sidebar continues to replace the old Finance accordion with one direct link:

`/finance/`

V102 cache-busts the shared presentation helper and disables ERP HTML caching as in V100 so a stale pre-deploy Finance menu cannot survive.

## Regression

Run:

```bash
python manage.py check_finance_hub_v102
```

The check is read-only and verifies:

- `/finance/` is exactly a three-card hub;
- no account preview is rendered on the hub;
- the sidebar Finance entry is a direct root link, not an accordion;
- `/finance/accounts/` renders every active account/person row from the DB;
- payments and calculator routes remain unchanged;
- every canonical current-capital component equals an independent recomputation from the same authoritative DB sources;
- the final capital equation balances exactly;
- no business state is written.

Expected marker:

`SUCCESS: FINANCE HUB + CAPITAL V102 CHECK PASSED`

## Deployment

Use:

`bash server_finance_hub_v102.sh`

Expected production marker:

`SUCCESS: FINANCE HUB + CAPITAL V102 DEPLOYED`

GitHub state alone is not production confirmation.
